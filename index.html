        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am new to the world of IT. I have made the decision to change careers about two years ago
          and I could not be more excited. I have been a teacher for the past decade.
          I am transitioning to a career in web development, which may seem like a complete opposite. 
          However, I have been fortunate enough to have gained experience with technology as a 
          teacher.</p>
        <p>I love to problem-solve, be challenged, and to learn. I also have an eye for
          details. When I am not practicing my web design skills, I enjoy spending time with my 
          family, reading, and shopping. I currently live in Akron, Ohio with my husband 
          and daughter.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to learn as much as I can about creating things for the web. I want to continue to expand my knowledge and increase my abilities in:</p>
